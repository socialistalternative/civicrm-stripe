# API

This extension comes with several APIs to help you troubleshoot problems. These can be run via /civicrm/api or via `cv api Stripe.xxx`.

The api commands are:

## Stripe

#### `Stripe.Listevents`:

Events are the notifications that Stripe sends to the Webhook. Listevents will list all notifications that have been sent. You can further restrict them with the following parameters:

    * `ppid` - Use the given Payment Processor ID. By default, uses the saved, live Stripe payment processor and throws an error if there is more than one.
    * `type` - Limit to the given Stripe events type. By default, show invoice.payment_succeeded. Change to 'all' to show all.
    * `output` - What information to show. Defaults to 'brief' which provides a summary. Alternatively use raw to get the raw JSON returned by Stripe.
    * `limit` - Limit number of results returned (100 is max, 10 is default).
    * `starting_after` - Only return results after this event id. This can be used for paging purposes - if you want to retreive more than 100 results.
    * `source` - By default, source is set to "stripe" and limited to events reported by Stripe in the last 30 days. If instead you specify "systemlog" you can query the `civicrm_system_log` table for events, which potentially go back farther then 30 days.
    * `subscription` - If you specify a subscription id, results will be limited to events tied to the given subscription id. Furthermore, both the `civicrm_system_log` table will be queried and the results will be supplemented by a list of expected charges based on querying Stripe, allowing you to easily find missing charges for a given subscription.
    * `filter_processed` - Set to 1 if you want to filter out results for contributions that have been properly processed by CiviCRM already.

#### `Stripe.Populatelog`:

This API call will populate your SystemLog with all of your past Stripe Events. You can safely re-run and not create duplicates. With a populated SystemLog - you can selectively replay events that may have caused errors the first time or otherwise not been properly recorded. Parameters:

    * `ppid` - Use the given Payment Processor ID. By default, uses the saved, live Stripe payment processor and throws an error if there is more than one.
    * `type` - The event type - defaults to invoice.payment_succeeded.

The standard API3 "limit" option is also supported and if specified will limit the total number of events to that limit (default 0).

#### `Stripe.Populatewebhookqueue`:

    * `ppid` - Use the given Payment Processor ID. By default, uses the saved, live Stripe payment processor and throws an error if there is more than one.
    * `type` - The event type - defaults to invoice.payment_succeeded.

The standard API3 "limit" option is also supported and if specified will limit the total number of events to that limit (default 0).

#### `Stripe.Ipn`:

Replay a given Stripe Event. Parameters. This will always fetch the chosen Event from Stripe before replaying.

    * `id` - The id from the SystemLog of the event to replay.
    * `evtid` - The Event ID as provided by Stripe.
    * `ppid` - Use the given Payment Processor ID. By default, uses the saved, live Stripe payment processor and throws an error if there is more than one.
    * `noreceipt` - Set to 1 if you want to suppress the generation of receipts or set to 0 or leave out to send receipts normally.

#### `Stripe.Retryall`:

Attempt to replay all charges for a given payment processor that are completed in Stripe but not completed in CiviCRM.

    * `ppid` - Use the given Payment Processor ID. By default, uses the saved, live Stripe payment processor and throws an error if there is more than one.
    * `limit` - Limit number of results (25 is default).

#### `Stripe.Cleanup`:

Cleanup and remove old database tables/fields that are no longer required.
